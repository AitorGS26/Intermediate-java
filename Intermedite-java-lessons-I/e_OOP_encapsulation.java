/* Tip to remember:
A class has atributes and methods.

**The atributes are the variables of our class**
**The methods are the functions our class will do**

* We have to distinguish well the difference between a public and private class,
the encapsulation is an important thing, it indicates the public atributes
for owing the review or modification of them

* In the same way also the private ones are for not allowing anyone to review or
modificate them.

*In conclusion the encapsulation consist on hide the atributes and methods of a class
for avoiding them being modified.

There are 4 access modifiers:

*public         *default
*protected      *private

We've been usin the encapsulation without knowing what we were doing,
by now on we'll know and for a better understanding we'll do the following exercise:

Zero company asks for a development of a programmed class in java, for the logical functions of
a new line of dishwashers with the following characteristics:
    1- It has to receive the kg and type of dishes by arguments
    2- It has to have filling, dishing and drying functions
    3- The class has to ve well encapsuled, for avoiding future unnecesary methods
    or variables by the programmers of Zero
    4-The only method to import will be cycle completed.
