/* As we've seen, encapsuling is the way we show or we hide some class atributes in our code 
for other programmers interaction with our creations.
 * 
 * Sometimes is neccesary to let permisson to have acces to someone to an atribute of the class, 
 without deleting the encapsuling, for this job we use setter and getter.

 * The "set" method => it assigns a value to an atribute of our class, it has to have void in it's 
 structure and it always have to have an input parameter. Its like "here in this class i've put a 
 pointer"

 * The "get" method => it  give us the value of the atribute we want, it has to return a value,
 not as set method, so the structure of this method will include the value we want to return.

 ** The exercise we'll do for practice, will be done at the washing machine project, 
 for looking into the code, please go there.

 **The exercise will simulate the following, Zero company, after a year they contact with us 
 for telling us from now on the machines will only wash as intense mode. So they need to give 
 their programmers permisson to acces to the variable clotheType, for deleting it because of 
 it's uselesness */
