/*
 * Polymorfism in OOP, is to give a method the capacity of have different behaviour 
 depending on the created instance.

 * For example => Supose someone called Paco is a method and he receives two calls.

 * on the one side if the call is fot getting a job or from his bosses Paco will have a formal behaviour.
 * on the other side if the call is from a friend, Paco will have an informal behaviour.
  
 * In conclusion the polimorfism consists on comunicating one method with the different clasess
 and depending on with which have the comunication, it's behaviour will be one or other.

 For a better understanding, there will be a project called "j_OOP_polimorfism"
