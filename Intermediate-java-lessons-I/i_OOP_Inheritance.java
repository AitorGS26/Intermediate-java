/* Inheritance is a word that I've been hearing since I started learning java
 today is the day we'll learn what is this and for what is used.

 ** Inheritance in java is a process for reusing code when we create new classes, for not typing again
 
 *** What we do is to indicate the program that we want to use the variables 
 and functions of a previously created class

 *** In other words, we can use the methods and atributes of a class that exists previously
 and put them inside a new class without writing the same code again
 
 **ATRIBUTES == VARIABLES
 **METHODS == THE FUNCTIONS OF A CLASS
 
 * The inheritance is a huge advantage, the programmer will use less code and less time for 
 the same work
 
 When we use the inheritance, there are two terms really important on this:
 
  ** The "father" class, or base class => Here is the code that we'll use in the future, the
  atributes and the methods, here we declare all the variables and methods which are going 
  to make some parts of the program work.

  ** The "son" or "doughter" class, or derived class => This is the class that will "inherit" the atributes
  and methods, that were created on the father class. Here those elements will be used without 
  writing them again 
  
  ** In programming there are TWO tipes of inheritance:
   
  - Simple inheritance => THE ONLY ONE WE USE IN JAVA
     
    * A son class will only have ONE father class, but the father class can have more than
     one son class

  - Multiple inheritance => WE DON'T USE THIS IN JAVA
   
   **IN CONCLUSION => Inheritance is the way tu reuse the previously creted code, for not writing it
   one and again.
   
   ** For a better understanding, there is a project "i_inheritance project" where is all explained
   with an example.*/
