/*Exceptions in programming are a way to work on some weird situations that happen when we execute a 
program. It's an error control.

* Some cases of that situations are:
  *Make a method over a null object
  *Try to open a non existant directory
  *Try to divide a number over 0
  
  An exception is an anomallous situation that can happen when we execute a program
  
  The way the programmer resolve this annomally is known as exception management
  
  * Exceptions are a tool for allowing the programmer to have situation under control
  with code that at the beggining is not working as it has to.*
  
  In java there are reserved words for the management of the exceptions:

    * try
    * cath
    * finally
  
  There will be a project for a better understanding => n_exceptions_project*/
