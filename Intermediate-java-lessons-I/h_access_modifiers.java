/* Access modifiers allow to give a major security to our clases, keeping restricted the access 
to different atributes, metthods and contructors.

 * In java we've 4 access modifiers:
 
 * public       => It allows the acces to the element from every class, it doesn't matter if it comes 
                   from the same package or from other package.
 * protected    => Protected is like default, it only have access from the same packages, not others.
 * private      => Private is the most restrictive access modifiers,private especifies that there only
                   will have access from the class inside they are, nowhere more. The only way to
                   have access to it is with setter and getter methods.
 * default      => It doesn't have any reserved word asociated, it's known as default or package-private.
                   When we don't specify any acces modifier, it's used the default acces modifier, 
                   this could be only be accesed by the classes which are inside the same package.
    
    We'll make projects, for explaining this, 
    - h_Default_modifier_project
    - h_Public_modifier_project
    - h_Private_modifier_project
    - h_Protected_modifier_project
