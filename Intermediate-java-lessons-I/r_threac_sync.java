/*Thread sincronization allow the control of time for different theads run simultaneously 
  
 * The objective is to avoid the posibility of one thread bother another thread's behaviour.
  
 * Also for stablish and order of execution in our program using threads
  
 * It looks like it's easy, but for more understanding, there will be a project
 called r_thread_sync_project, where we'll work with 4 threads simmultaneously and sincronyzed.*/
